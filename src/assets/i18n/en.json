      "BIO": "2020, time for X-Wave to return to the heyday of trance, from the 90s to the mid-2000s, but with its zest of modernity. This fast and energetic vibe which takes its source in the planing rhythms of the seventies, projects you into a parallel world.
      Goa, shrink, hard, prog, here trance is in the spotlight through a 2h format, including 1h provided by a finely selected guest, and 1h at the controls of GTI and Dj Sueur. A trip is announced and the destination wants to be psychedelic."
